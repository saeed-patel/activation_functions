    "\n",
    "### Role of Activation Functions in Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Activation functions play a crucial role in neural networks by determining the output of a neuron given a set of inputs. They introduce non-linearities into the model, enabling the network to learn complex patterns and relationships within the data. Without activation functions, the neural network would simply perform linear transformations, limiting its ability to model complex data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linear vs. Nonlinear Activation Functions\n",
    "### Linear Activation Functions:\n",
    "- A linear activation function is of the form 𝑓(𝑥) = 𝑎𝑥, where 𝑎 is a constant.\n",
    "- The output is directly proportional to the input.\n",
    "- While linear functions are simple and easy to compute, they suffer from several limitations:\n",
    "    - Limited learning capacity: Linear functions can't model non-linear relationships, reducing the network's expressive power.\n",
    "    - No multiple layers advantage: Stacking multiple layers with linear activation is equivalent to a single-layer linear transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nonlinear Activation Functions:\n",
    "- Nonlinear activation functions introduce non-linearity into the network, allowing it to learn and represent complex patterns.\n",
    "- Common nonlinear activation functions include:\n",
    "    - Sigmoid: 𝑓(𝑥) = 1 / 𝑒−𝑥 \n",
    "        - Smooth, S-shaped curve.\n",
    "        - Outputs values between 0 and 1.\n",
    "        - Drawbacks: vanishing gradient problem.\n",
    "    - Tanh: 𝑓(𝑥) = 𝑒𝑥 − 𝑒−𝑥 / 𝑒𝑥 + 𝑒−𝑥 \n",
    "        - Outputs values between -1 and 1.\n",
    "        - Centered around zero, which can lead to faster convergence than sigmoid.\n",
    "    - ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit): 𝑓(𝑥) = max(0,𝑥)\n",
    "        - Outputs zero for negative inputs and the input itself for positive inputs.\n",
    "        - Efficient and helps mitigate the vanishing gradient problem.\n",
    "        - Drawback: \"dead neurons\" for consistently negative inputs.\n",
    "    - Leaky ReLU: Similar to ReLU but allows a small gradient for negative inputs to prevent dead neurons.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preference for Nonlinear Activation Functions in Hidden Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonlinear activation functions are preferred in hidden layers because they enable the network to approximate complex, non-linear relationships within the data. This non-linearity is essential for the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Expressive Power: Nonlinear functions allow the network to learn and represent complex patterns, enabling it to solve more sophisticated problems.\n",
    "2. Layer Interactions: The combination of non-linear functions across multiple layers allows the network to build hierarchical features, progressively learning more abstract representations of the input data.\n",
    "3. Function Approximation: According to the Universal Approximation Theorem, a neural network with at least one hidden layer and non-linear activation functions can approximate any continuous function to a desired level of accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, if only linear activations were used, the entire network would collapse into a single linear transformation, regardless of the number of layers, limiting the network's capacity to learn complex patterns.\n",
